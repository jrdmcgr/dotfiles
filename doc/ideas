# Ideas

- Make a plain text ticketing system
  - v1 a folder of markdown files
  - each file is a ticket
  - a ticket has a title, body, and yaml metadata
  - when we get a lot of tickets, they can be grouped into epics by placing them in subfolders
  - they can be ranked by prefixing them with an ordinal
